## Overview

In both data science and academic research, prediction modeling is often not enough; to answer many questions, we need to approach them causally. In this workshop, we’ll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting. We’ll also show that by distinguishing predictive models from causal models, we can better take advantage of both tools. You’ll be able to use the tools you already know--the tidyverse, regression models, and more--to answer the questions that are important to your work.



## Learning objectives

[ADD AN ITEMIZED LIST OF LEARNING OBJECTIVES.]

## Is this course for me?

This course will be appropriate for you if you answer yes to these questions:

- Do you know how to fit a linear regression model in R?
- Do you have a basic understanding of data manipulation and visualization using tidyverse tools?
- Are you interested in understanding the fundamentals behind how to move from estimating correlations to causal relationships?

## Prework

\[ADD INFORMATION YOU WANT LEARNERS TO HAVE / STEPS THEY WANT THEM TO
COMPLETE PRIOR TO THE WORKSHOP. THIS COULD BE A LINK TO A THREAD ON
RSTUDIO COMMUNITY, PACKAGE INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS, HOW TO GET AN
RSTUDIO.CLOUD ACCOUNT, ETC.\]
