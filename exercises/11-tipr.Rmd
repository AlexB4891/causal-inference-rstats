```{r}
library(tipr)
```

We are interested in examining the relationship between whether there were "Extra Magic Hours" in the morning (the **exposure**) and the average wait time for the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train the same day between 9am and 10am (the **outcome**).

## Your turn

Use the `tip_coef()` function to conduct a sensitivity analysis for the estimate from your previous exercises.

```{r}

tipr::tip_coef(effect = 0.3, #Effect
               smd =  0.5)   # Calculate the smd




tipr::tip_coef(effect = 0.3, #Effect
               smd =  seq(0,1,0.1)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(smd, outcome_association)) +# Calculate the smd
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()


```
